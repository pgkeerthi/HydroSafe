# HydroSafe

Access to clean and safe drinking water is a fundamental human right and a critical factor for public health. This project leverages data analytics to evaluate water potability and identify factors influencing water quality. Using a dataset of physicochemical properties such as pH, turbidity, hardness, and dissolved solids, machine learning techniques are employed to classify water samples as potable or non-potable.

The study integrates data preprocessing methods to handle missing values, outliers, and scaling issues, ensuring robust model training. Various classification algorithms, including logistic regression, decision trees, and neural networks, are compared to determine the optimal predictive model. Feature importance analysis highlights key parameters affecting potability, providing actionable insights for water quality management.

The project demonstrates how data analytics can aid in monitoring water safety, enabling proactive interventions to mitigate contamination risks. Its findings contribute to sustainable development goals by supporting data-driven decision-making for ensuring safe water access globally.
